Hello! Ready to talk about coffee?
Hey there! What coffee-related question do you have for me?
The world of coffee is vast! You've got Espresso, Macchiato, Cortado, Flat White, and more.
The brewing method affects the taste! Do you prefer a smooth Pour Over, a strong Espresso, or a classic Drip Coffee?
