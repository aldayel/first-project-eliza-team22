## Brief Introduction

The Eliza Task is inspired by one of the first natural language processing (NLP) programs, ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in the 1960s. ELIZA uses pattern matching and substitution to simulate human-like conversations. The most famous script, "DOCTOR," emulates a Rogerian psychotherapist. This task aims to build a web-based version of ELIZA that can interact with users by simulating a conversation.
